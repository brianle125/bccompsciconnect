BCCompSciConnect is being created in the pursuit of addressing the lack of ample resources to connect like-minded individuals within the post-secondary computing science community. Current popular resources are either too discouraging to newcomers or otherwise lack appropriate focus oriented around a post-secondary environment.

Our proposed application would be developed to provide a dedicated platform that allows students to connect and share ideas. We aim to provide a central hub where university students can come together, share insights, and explore opportunities for collaborative tech projects, etc. Our goal is to provide a beginner-friendly and user-centric experience and an educational atmosphere that fosters learning and collaboration. The target audience for our application are students from BC institutions: SFU, UBC, BCIT, and the like.
